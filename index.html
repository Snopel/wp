          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I have completed previous courses and coded recreationally for the past three years. So far I have learned C++, C#, Java and now currently
              learning web development languages; HTML5, PHP, JavaScript and CSS. My experiene in these areas has just begun, but I hope to expand my
              knowledge through the outcome of this course! :)</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I see myself as a programmer and am hoping to also be adept at design as well, as design is a huge part of programming. This is something
              I am currently learning through Further Programming. Analytical thinking is a workflow in which I am really beginning to see the benefits
              of, as I am currently analysing even menial tasks like putting dishes away to further improve my programming experience even away from
              the computer!</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>Career path. My dream is to be a software developer and to understand all that there is to coding and making things work through language.
              I originally studied Electrical Engineering, however I ended up changing course as the electrical side of it just wasn't interesting
              me and I personally felt all the software-based tasks were something I seemed to excel at, so I decided to specialise in what I love: Software
              Engineering!</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I hope that through this course I can expand my software development knowledge to the giant of programming known as the Internet. This is where
              the world's knowledge is all accumulated and kept for the entire world to see and learn from. I wish to be able to further add my mark into this
              vast network by learning how to code and develop website applications and perhaps increase my 'resume' and reliability as a programmer in the
              work field.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>I'm fairly adaptable to new ideas and I love to listen and comprehend how other people think in this great network of ideas and accomplishments.
              I'm an analytical thinker and also like to solve logical problems and hence figure out how to transfer what we know into a program that operates
              under its determined requirements. I would appreciate a team who shares my way of thinking anaylitcally so we can break down, solve and apply the
              problem together efficiently and effectively. Accepting new ideas and being open minded is also a very helpful trait rather than being stuck up and
              believing your opinion is the only one that matters. If that's you, please stay away. Thank you.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>This is a very tough question as I often surf the internet at my leisure. Commonly, I use the website Reddit as a source of new information
              and recreation in conjunction with what I do in every day life. I guess Facebook is a given to catch up with friends and see what everyone is up to
              these days. If I'm really that bored, I might head onto Kongregate and have a dabble into a community-driven online game site and observe how people
              can use programming to make something so fun and interesting. Who knows? I can learn something from it!</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I guess I spend majority of my time playing video games as much of this generation also shares interest in, playing online and trying to make my footprint
              in this overwhelming community. In my downtime, I play the guitar when I'm getting a bit overheated from online shenanigans to sorta calm down and get away
              from bright screens so I don't go blind in the future.
              Of course when I have the time, I also like to program and try learn things myself and make mistakes to see how to fix them to further enhance my proficiency
              as a programmer.</div>
